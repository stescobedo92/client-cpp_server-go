# client-cpp_server-go
This project consists of a server written in `Golang` and a client application implemented in `C++` using MSVC. The server-client architecture facilitates communication between the two components, enabling data exchange and interaction.
The server and client are designed to communicate seamlessly. Ensure the server is running before launching the client to establish a connection.
Feel free to customize the code and adapt it to your specific needs.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the server, follow these steps:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:stescobedo92/client-cpp_server-go.git
$ cd server
$ go build
$ go run

```
To compile and run the Client, follow these steps:

- Ensure you have Microsoft Visual Studio installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

- Open the `client` directory in Microsoft Visual Studio.

- Build the C++ `client` application using MSVC.

- Run the compiled `client` executable.
